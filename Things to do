Things to do:
1. Use the coding challenge from a few weeks prior as a base outline --> change it to fit the colour sceem and sprits the group wants 
2. Change the program so that if the enemy touches the player, a math releated question appears (most likely using if statements)
3. Animate the sprits to move
4. Add the money factor--> answer question incorrectly= lose money
